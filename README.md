# linear-regression-project
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It includes various features such as brand, model, material, and other attributes that influence the price of shoes. The dataset is loaded and processed to ensure quality and accuracy for model training.

## Project Structure
- `data_loading.py`: Module for loading data from a CSV file.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Module for preprocessing data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
- `model_training.py`: Module for training and evaluating various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR).
- `visualization.py`: Module for visualizing results.
- `main.py`: Main script that integrates all modules and allows selecting different models for training and evaluation.

## Usage
